 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Roman Republic has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since its restoration in the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Rome's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster? Democracy or Imperial rule once again?"
